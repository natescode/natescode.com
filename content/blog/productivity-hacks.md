Productivity Life Hacks for Sofware Engineers.

My co-worker, Abdullahi, encouraged me to write this post. Since I'm on Thanskgiving vacation, I thought why not? Plus, writting this post proves him correct; I'm *very* productive. 

I generally don't think of myself as very productive. I was diagnosed with ADHD, like my father, and I've always tried to take on too many projects, jobs and challenges at once. 

I work 2 jobs, sometimes 3, I am a father of twin girls that are in school plus I make time to work on NatesCode blog posts, videos, exercise and be a son, boyfriend and play DnD. How do I find time?

A part of the answer is that not what I **DO** have time for but which activities I don't do that most others do. I don't watch T.V., I've never owned cable and Cobra Kai is the only TV I've finished in the last decade. I don't
go out with friends as much as others might. 

Here is my schedule for example:


## NatesCode\'s Schedule

| 45m      | 06:45 | Drive kids to school |

## Weekends

I have my kids every other week so I'm free every other weekend. I play DnD 1-2 weekends per month, kids play with the other kids of DnD parents.
I spend time with family, girlfriend and work on Natescode stuff in the evenings on free weekends and week days. 



## FAQS

### Only 15 minutes to prep kids for school?

Yes, I lay out their outfits the night before. They have their own alarm clocks to wake up. They know how to
brush their teeth and get dressed themselves. I also already have their backpacks ready by the door. 


### 7 1/2 hours of sleep?

Yes, that is enough for me. I **RARELY** get less than 7.5 - 8 hours of sleep. Sleep is critical to being able to be productive.

### What else? 

Lists, Make a list for the day, week and month. I have lists with priorities at work. Prioritizing is SO importanty. You can do **ANYTHING** with your time but *not* **EVERYTHING**.

### How can I be productive NOW ?

You can't, think long term. You have to make small, sustainable changes. I gave up alcohol this year (2024). 

### Where to find time?

WEEKENDS. I do NOT work, or make any big commitments on weekends. My weekends are sacred.
