Welcome to another Beyond Code series blog post. Today, we're covering something kinda negative, fake gurus and fake senior developers.

I see plenty of authoritative blogs "teaching" others the "right way". The posts are made purely to build ego and reputation. They're made by fakes that actually don't know what they're talking about. They often mean well but the Dunning-Krugger effect makes them think they're smarter than they really are.

Let's go over how to spot them.

Absolute Titles
Titles like "STOP..." "ALWAYS" "NEVER" "NO ONE" "EVERYONE" or fire your best developer.

Of course this is just common because clickbait unfortunately still works.

Lack of nuance
Similar to the titles there is no nuance. 100% code coverage, okay 100% of what? Line, block, branch, class? If it is so important than explain in more detail

Lack of experience
It isn't clear to more junior developers unfortunately but I can easily tell one someone doesn't know what they're talking about. They have very basic examples and don't go into great detail. Saying "mixins are inheritance" for instance isn't quite correct. There is no Is-A relationship created. Mixins are object composition.

There is never a mention of "when I was on X project. I ran into this problem" because the experience isn't there.

Knowledge is like raw ingredients, Experience is like those ingredients mixed and baked into a cake.

Combative Ego
I've run into this a lot on Dev and my career in general. The OP can't handle simple clarification questions or constructive feedback. I tried to ask why someone was making a backup branch in Git. Branches just point at the latest commit anyways so it seemed like a more newb thing to do (I did it before I knew Git well). The OP decided to question me and be rude versus expand on why they were "nervously running git command"

Quantity not Quality
You'll see a lot of short, frequent videos, blogs etc. that don't mention or link advanced concepts. They stick to simple concepts and short posts to get more views. The goal of the content is to boost their ego, not to actually teach anyone. Again, the content is focused on the author than the subject.

Again, there is nuance here. Some DO make high quality shorter content. These are generalities. Some actually make fairly long content that has little to no substance and is nothing more than a rant.

Opinions over Experience
"Tailwind is evil"

"CSS is already natural. Why learn something else that offers no extra benefit. Thats just arrogant framework behavior if you ask me. Tailwind CSS is basically saying: "We're better than the people who came up with CSS, so we're just going to rename a small percentage of CSS syntax to custom classnames, cuz we're rebel bruh!"

Both quotes from someone who just happened to need a full component library that had built-in a11y support, Tailwind doesn't have aria-labels etc. because it is ONLY CSS. So their 'opinion' is just that, only backed by the negative emotions of choosing the wrong tool for the job. Yet they call anyone that uses the tool 'arrogant' and the tool 'evil'. Is it arrogant and evil to use a screwdriver? No, but according to him it is because he needed a hammer and screwdrivers are bad hammers.

Conclusion
I don't blog much because I have about 3 dozen posts in progress and I'm a perfectionist. I also lost a few posts that I had on Medium.com since their woke culture banned me for stating facts. I don't see the point in contributing to the noise.
