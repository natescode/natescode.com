## JavaScript-Only Developers

JavaScript-Only Developers are coming !
This post is ultimately about having a broad set of perspectives and experiences, not JavaScript.

JavaScript is popular and relatively easy for beginners to learn. Brandon Eich created it in 10 days for non-programmers after all.

It is only natural to see so much dislike by JPDa for other languages, especially with static typing. Junior developers don't like being told their code is not type safe. They don't like to think or struggle. Just NPM install your problems away.

Most JavaScript developers don't know much. They're mainly front-end developers, with maybe some JS backend experience, and haven't worked on real enterprise-grade projects.

They don't have a CS background so they're often missing a lot of therapy.

JavaScript and front-end development has a really low barrier to entry. Mostly average skilled people.

I recently saw someone hate on C# and leave their C# job. I could tell from their attitude it wasn't C# but the job or maybe they just struggled to learn a more traditional OOP statically typed language that isn't JavaScript. Calling the subject dumb is a way to feel better about oneself. Marking my reply as low quality just proved their immaturity.

Most developers are terrible these days. They're self-taught programmers chasing the 6 figure remote dream job. It is ironic, I have what everyone wants but I actually got into code because I like it, not for the money or little prestige that accompanied tbe title "software engineer" even though strictly speaking we are not engineers

They're learning from 6 different sources and think tutorials will get them a job.

Only 30% of bootcamp students even graduate. My first cohort made me want to quit as an instructor. The students gave me terrible ratings but NEVER had their camera on in class, NEVER asked questions, NEVER came to the 75 minutes of office hours (3 times per week) and NEVER tried. They were so entitled. They demanded I just lecture them until they learned to code via osmosis or something. Talk about laziness. This is ALL too common.

You have to code to learn to code.

## NO, NOT everyone can code

Sure everyone can learn to read and write but how many will do it professionally?

Code is no different. Last year, I spent 3 months interviewing dozens of "senior" developers from our India office, 99% couldn't code Fizz Buzz. They said they knew JavaScript but couldn't answer the most basic questions about it.

Most of my students still struggle with syntax and basic concepts after 6 months. One reason I'm pursuing making my own online, completely free bootcamps, natescodecamp.org .

## How to not be a garbage programmer

Focus on concepts not NPM packages. The tell-tale sign of a junior programmer is they talk about what they know "I know jQuery, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Node, Express, Vue, React...' instead of what they can build.

Too many blog with authority and strong opinions but don't have ANY real experience. A teen developer said ORMs are bad in the long run, what long run? He hasn't worked on enterprise projects for a decade. He only knows Javascript ORMs which are NOT used at large companies. He's all hat and no cattle as they say.

I just went two a communist college because coding bootcamps existed. I taught myself in high school. I caught up to my 4 year CS peers by reading the same books (just look up the syllabus for each class) while having more experience than them.

I learned 6 programming languages in college: VB, C#, PHP, JavaScript, Java and Python. I also learned other languages: HTML, CSS and SQL.

I've been in software for over 10 years now. I have what everyone wants, the cushy remote 6 figure job working in my PJs (rarely so that actually).

So please, broaden your horizons and don't be narrow-minded. The problem isn't JavaScript but low-skill, entitled, greedy wannabes.

JODs say everything should be in JavaScript, not because it should but they're too lazy to learn other tools.

Too many "developers" on here just bait me into an argument or tell me I don't know anything when I've actually been shipping enterprise code for a decade while they've just made a little cute blog after their bootcamp.
