## A Lesson in Statistics

**Disclaimen**

_this is my opinion. I use a TON of data and facts here. NO this does NOT mean I think women don't experience sexism and sexual harrasement in tech, unfortunately too many men are pigs and this does happen. The DATA does NOT show potential sexim in hiring or firing decisions. I love women and hope my daughters don't ever fear a STEM career because of the unique struggles women face in tech_

If you spend anytime in tech, you'll hear about the push to get more women into tech. While a noble effort, it is often backed by false conclusions, lies and double standards. I am going to use facts and statistics. I understand that those that want
to discredit me will make sexist remarks to attempt to discredit facts. Please, disagree with me, NOT my identity. My intention are pure. I don't want my twin daugters thinking tech is sexist and that men don't want them in tech.

I mentioned double standards. Do women have more economic opportunities in India or the USA? USA you say? Then why are 40% of computer science majors women in India and only 20% are women in US? I'll link some research here.

FACT: 21% of USA software engineers are women.

media: "WE NEED MORE WOMEN IN TECH! SEXISM! PATRIARCHY!"

FACT: .1% of USA carpenters are women.

media: _crickets_

90% of workplace deaths are men. 90% of blue collar workers are men. "equality" ONLY at the top is not equality.

STEM is about science, not feelings.

> "women make 70 cents for ever 1 dollar a man makes", for the same job, hours etc... 100% only because of sexism. -- misinformed person

This is

1. completely false
2. harmful to women trying to make it in the tech world.

This is teaching women to fear working in male dominated fields. Which keeps out talented women from pursuing a STEM career in the first place. This also makes people look like they failed statistics.

## Income Gap vs Wage Gap

If Luna and Max both make $20/hour, they have the same **wage**. If Max works 46 hours per week and Luna works 40 then Max will make $980 (1.5X for overtime in US) and Luna $800. Luna makes _81.6%_ of what Max does; an _income_ gap. Overtime and unpaid time off major factors in total _income_. The gap isn't inherently proof of sexism. Yet lie and say women are paid less than men for the same job and hours.

Men tend to choose higher paying specialization as well. There are more female front-end devs than database admins.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics does NOT give enough information to know _if_ women are paid differently than men when accounting for experience, career, specialty, skills, hours work, unpaid PTO etc. It merely gets the average income of all men and all women. Men and women tend to chose different careers. Comparing school teachers to engineers is an apples-to-oranges comparison.

Men dominate 9/10 of the highest paying college degrees.

![Highest Paying College Majors by Gender](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a7duik5tshh1h7cub161.png)

The following quoted and linked paper showed that women made 82% (**INCOME GAP** of what men made as union workers where the ONLY factors are _pay rate_ (based on seniority), overtime worked and unpaid time off. The only two factors towards total.

> "Mechanically, the earnings gap can be explained in our setting by the fact that men take
> 48% fewer unpaid hours off and work 83% more overtime hours per year than women"

[Gap explained in this paper from harvard](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf)

Statistics are dangerous because humans jump to conclusions. The report shows TOTAL earnings of all men and women that work full-time. Full-time is defined as 35+ hours per week. Total hours worked, specialty and years of experience aren't taken into account. To try to use this date to prove there is sexism is incorrect. We simply cannot conclude either way from this data.

Yes, men make more but men also work more hours doing more dangerous jobs. Now if we adjust for these factors to specifically find the gap that is solely based on gender, then great! Then we'd have data to discuss and a possible gender pay gap to fix. The US Bureau of Labor statistics does NOT account for this and thusly is worthless in determining if women are paid less simply because they are women.

Again, Women do have their struggles. For example, even where studies appropriate compare _pay rate_ between men and women, that still won't show if there is discrimination in the hiring, firing or promotion. You can't compare if a woman doesn't get the job at all.
Mainly, they do most of the unpaid household labor, child rearing and in third world countries fetching water etc. This is why unpaid labor should be included in a nation's GDP. Phyllis Deane came up with this idea but she was shut down by myoginist men who didn't think unpaid female labor was valuable, IT IS VERY valuable.

To say that women are actually making 82% of what a man makes for working the SAME job and the SAME hours is a straight out lie and illegal; in the United States at least since the [1963 equal pay act](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/equal-pay-act-1963). There is ZERO evidence of a such a large gap across be board. THIS IS NOT to say that some individual organizations have fair pay. I'm not saying laws completely prevent sexist employer practices, they sadly do not.

This is sadly a very politically sensitive topic which is silly. We can look at the facts and fix them. If 21% is not enough women in tech, then why is 15.6% enough men in nursing? Why is .1% enough women in carpentry? This is a double standard. Either, we want equality of opportunity where people can choose different paths or FORCE people against everyone's will forju equality of outcome. The latter would force women to do dangerous, dirty, outside, laborious jobs against their will. Psychology has shown that women prefer people and men prefer things. Things tend to pay more.

I want my daughters to pursue whatever career they desire. Hearing that they make less for the same job and hours as men doesn't help them, especially when it isn't true. These lies only keep women out of tech. We need people of all types in tech. I made far more than all my female class-mates in high school. Why? Because I did dirty, outside, laborious jobs. I was crawling under cabins to silver soldering burst pipes or bailing hay. "but females probably wouldn't get hired even if they applied", this is a "what if" arguement but sure, especially in small town USA, myoginist men and women (yes an old lady paid me more for yard work than my sister because "men are more productive", her words).

We need to keep everyone informed of facts and encourage everyone to pursue whatever they want, not just STEM. We push women into STEM yet not into blue collar jobs like trucking, machining, plumbing, construction, landscaping etc. . .we are 90%+ male dominated, why? Because feminists only want equality at the top aka a double standard, not true equality. I.E. Women in the US get to vote and get federal student loans without signing up for the selective service (draft) while men do. Equal rights, less responsibility.

Everyone should pursue STEM or science in general, requires logic the scientific method. If we abandon logic for emotions then can no longer help anyone.

STEM is about facts and following the scientific method. Not about feelings. The fact is, on a large scale, WOMEN are NOT being paid less than men inside or outside of tech.

I hope this helps clear up some myths and encourages women that would otherwise avoid STEM. While sexism unfortunately exists in many other areas, no you won't get a 20% pay cut just because you lack a Y chromosome.

## Lawsuits and Pay adjustments

Google did an internal audit and according to them found that men were being underpaid. If that is true, then great that made things more equal! Yet this was unpopular for many women at Google. American politics think that women are ALWAYS
the victim, men the perpetrators and men can NEVER be the victim. Another double standard to enjoy. Google was also sued by several female software engineers, accusing Google of paying them less based ond their sex. Again, I don't know if this is true
but that doesn't really matter. IF men OR women are paid less solely based on their sex, that is wrong. It really is a pretty simple idea to grasp, yet American politics is about identity NOT logic. All you have to do is say I'm a priviledge white straight cis-gender male (not completely true so thanks for assuming) and now even if I say the sky is blue, the earth is round and 1 + 1 = 2, I am magically wrong and evil.

## Conclusion

Sexism exist. Google got sued for pay discrimination against women too. Sexism exists but so do double standards. So please, save your sexist remarks. Disagree with my facts and conclusions all you want but NOT my identity.

The USA women's soccer team sued, AND WON, for sexim because they CHOSE to get less guaranteed pay and benefits than the men. The turned down the same deal as the men's team. Yes, men's team players play in other leagues to get benefits.

YET when COVID happened and the USE men's team got paid $0 (only paid for playing and win), the women's team kept getting paid and the men's team didn't claim sexim. Women are truely priviledged and powerful in the USA. A single false accusation of a man can ruin his life and even if the woman admits she lied she gets ZERO repurcussions I.E Amber Heard. Women get less prison time, live longer, control household spending etc. So let's save the which-sex-has-it-harder-game for another, NEVER, day.
