## Practial Learning

I think LeetCode is great, overrated due to hype over landing FAANG or similar
jobs.

I've rarely seen LeetCode in interviews and avoid those that due (even when I do well they don't pay well lol).

Leetcode is completely unlike REAL software development. That said, if a junior cannot due LeetCode easy or Code Battle RYU 1-5 problems then they may not be ready for a job.

Sofware is SO much more than a mathematcial decription and a single function. Even FAANG does systems design interviews, I've done a phone interview before and this is where I failed as a junior dev.
