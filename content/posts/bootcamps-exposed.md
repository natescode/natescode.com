## Truth of coding boot camps from a boot camp instructor

I’ve recently finished my third 6-month coding boot camp as an instructor. I’ve been a professional developer for 8+ years now. 80% of devs have less than 5 years experience as there is a huge boom of boot campers flooding the market and the internet. I feel like the voice of senior developers is drown out by naïve junior devs.

I got an AAS in programming before boot camps were a thing. I’ve read the same books as my CS degree counter parts. Now I interview potential developers.

Boot camps are great for lowering the barrier to entry to software. They’re bad because they lower the barrier to entry. Bootcamps want your money, bottom line. So they often advertise that anyone can code. Which isn’t exactly true. There are some prerequisites. If you don’t know what a ZIP file is or click the big ‘E’ to get to the internet, code is probably not for you. If you don’t like spending large amounts of time fixing issues and problem solving, software development isn’t for you.

Boot campers are little baby developers. They likely only know JavaScript, have a shallow understanding of OOP and have never written a complex project.

I think boot camps CAN be great but they aren’t enough. One has to spend a lot of time making their own mistakes, projects and learning. I know I spent hundreds and hundreds of ours learning from blogs then applying my knowledge for clients and making YouTube videos.

## Advertising: "Anyone can code"

Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. Anyone can code poorly. But very, very few and code well professionally. We all can write, myself included but you won't see me making a living from writing or winning a Pulitzer prize novel anytime soon.

Now you won’t make $100,000 right from a boot camp, maybe in San Francisco if you’re really, really exceptional but $117,000 is considered poverty there and rent can easily be $5,000 / month.

## Prepare BEFORE for attending a boot camp

Why wait and GAMBLE $10-15,000 USD to write your first line of code? This is as ridiculous and irresponsible as going to college to be a concert pianist without ever touching a piano or keyboard. Boot camps, colleges, universities WONT MAKE YOU A DEVELOPER, hard work and coding will.

I have too many entitled students that expect ME to teach them. If they don't learn, that's the teachers fault. They think they're paying for knowledge to be downloaded into their brains like Kung Fu was into Nero's brain in The Matrix.

Ive been interviewing developers to join my team and it has been tough. Many don’t know how to code or know the theory of code.

Practice makes perfect. Find a mentor and learn WHY and then apply it. It takes a lot of time and effort but it is possible!

I know the market is over saturated now more than ever and companies just aren’t hiring like they used to.
