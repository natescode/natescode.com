Software despite the stereotypes, does require soft skills. Software products have millions of lines of code. One developer cannot
possibly write that themselves. Collaboration is necessary. I've never been afraid to present or voice my opinion.

This is a fitting post because I recently landed my first lead / architect position where I'll be spending 70% of my time with people and 30% with code. The first time in 10 years that I won't be slinging code 40 hours per week. I'm really excited. I'll still be helping my team, writing code, but I'll also be mentoring, architecting and guiding the project to success and completion.
