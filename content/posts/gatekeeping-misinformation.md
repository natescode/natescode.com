# Gatekeeping Misinformation

This post should go viral due to my selection of two hot, divisive buzzwords. In all seriousness, this is an opinion post. I word _really_ hard to write quality posts, this is why my quantity is lower.

## Gatekeeping `this` not `this`

I feel like there is general support for gatekeeping misinformation. (I'm __NOT__ going political with this). Yet, when a software engineer with 2 decades of experience posted on LinkedIn that he has reservations about making blog posts to teach because teaching is so difficult to do well, even for someone competent like himself, he is accused of _"gatekeeping"_ as if _"gatekeeping"_ poor quality blog posts about technology is any different than the war on _"misinformation"_. 

> "gatekeeping noun - the activity of controlling, and usually limiting, general access to something."

If we don't gatekeep negative value technological misinformation then we gatekeep positive value technological information by allowing it to be hidden and diluted. Basically, if we allow the plethora of poor software blog posts, they will drown out the actual good quality teaching resources that do exist, effectively gatekeeping valuable information. 

The other day I was Google searching a technology I don't know a lot about, the point of Google search. The #1 ranked result was a Medium.com article that was poorly written, though I couldn't tell until I saw a comment debunking all the misinformation in the post. That is exactly the problem. I didn't know enough that the blog article was wrong. If it wasn't for that comment, I would have believed it until I ran into issues causing me to question my understanding.

## Curated Blogging Platform (sweblogs.dev)

This is subscription (for readers) an Invite only (for bloggers) platform that treats blog posts like pull requests: other bloggers
in the same space (sub-topic) have to review and approve your post. It'll be a bit like Stackoverflow with a reputation
system to ensure quality blog posts and limit WHO can review posts.

## Subscription

To prevent indexing by search engines, stolen content by humans and AI, alike, the blogging platform is subscription based. The prices are localized
so countries with lots of great devs, Brazil!, can still access great content.

### PROFIT sharing

Bloggers / writters are PAID a share of the site's profits. Writters are paid 100% of net revenue, basically after 
paying for costs to run the website and staff salaries, bloggers get 100% of the spoils, basically running like a non-profit. 

This is a blogging platform for tech bloggers, by tech bloggers.
