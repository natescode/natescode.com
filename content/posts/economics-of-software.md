Software development only exists because software *can* provide value to businesses and customers. I think many software developers, especially juniors and aspirining developers forget this. Yes, DSA have value and architecture has value. But at the end of the day if you aren't shipping code that provideds business value, your fancy purely functional, well architectued code doesn't matter.

YouTubers make it sound like all software engineers do is Leetcode in their interviews and solving complex problems by thinking all day. I've NEVER done a Leetcode interview for any job I've had. 

## Consulting / Contracting

I've done a fair amount of contracting. The value here is that a company is able to only pay for the software development that they need, when they need it. 


## Internal software

## Risk Mitigation / Compliance

Not all software produces revenue. Some of it is required to prevent loss of money, loss of customers or to comply with government regulations.

### Security

### Privacy

### Compliance

Companies have to comply with government regulations. Regulations apply to where they do business. Here is an imcomplete list of common laws companies have to comply with.

- ADA
- Privacy: GDPR, CCPA ...
- HIPAA

I work for an agricultural insurance company. We are required to send data to RMA (an agency under the USDA). ADA compliance to make websites and mobile applications accessible to the blind and others is also common. I remember a client I had was being sued for not having an ADA compliant website so we had to make changes for them.


### Client Retention

Some features prevent users from leaving a platform. Performance is often such a feature. If the product is unusable then no one will wait 5 minutes for a screen to load. Performance can limit a companies market cap as well.

## Startups

Software startups are interesting. Their value is mostly about their customer base. Even small applications like Worlde, which end up being sold for large amounts of money are mostly valuable due to their name and user base. I mean I could implement Wordle clone in a weekend but it was the first and recognized name.


Startups focus on speed to market to attract investors.
