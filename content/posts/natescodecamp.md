I'm extremely excited to announce the official launch of https://www.NatesCodeCamp.org , a completely free full-stack coding boot camp that teaches with its own code. Yes, 100% of NatesCodeCamp's code is open source! Build off of professional figma designs, read user stories, submit a PR and have a real developer code review it and see your code actually launch to NatesCodeCamp.org. No more learning from tiny, contrived to-do apps.

I'm a full-stack developer and owner of NatesCode LLC. I saw the struggle in my students when I was a bootcamp instructor. I struggled to show WHY and HOW advanced concepts worked with tiny pre-made projects. I wanted to show production code. I wanted to show the WHOLE SDLC process, from planning to PR to deployment (automated of course).

NatesCodeCamp is 100% FREE, no ads, no charge. You can support via donates, affiliate links, buying merchandise AND by contributing. The 'COST' is that as the student progresses through the boot camp, they're required to start contributing back to the boot camp. Start with feedback, then documentation, create a unit test, and work your way up to fixing bugs and create brand new features! We'll gently guide you along the way and make sure no one else steals your tasks with a swift PR (we've all been there).

Not only will you get valuable practical and theoretical software knowledge BUT you will also have experience developing new features for a large production application on a large asynchronous distributed team. (We'll even teach you how to use all those fancy buzzwords that I just used).

So PLEASE join NatesCodeCamp.org today! I made $0 from it. The site is currently 100% funded by NatesCode LLC's IT consulting endeavors. My dream and goal is to have NatesCodeCamp.org break off into a 501(c)(3) non-profit that is self-sustaining. I will NEVER draw salary or profit from it.
