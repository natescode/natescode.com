Scrum: planning poker and basic statistics

Scrum: the religion no one follows.

So project managers don't understand basic statistics and estimates.

Estimate: "an approximate calculation or judgment of the value, number, quantity, or extent of something."

Question

If a team finished sprint #1 and they completed 20 points of work. How much work can they do the next sprint?

a) at least 20
b) 20 or less
c) 20 Â± the standard deviation
d) no idea

Every. single. Company. That I've ever worked for chose A. THEN complain that we fail sprints. :facepalm.

Here is a bell curve chart.

Bell Curve

68.2 % of the time, we'll be within 1 standard deviation. A standard deviation is just the average variation. So 50% of the time we will be UNDER the average . . .should be obviously but for business people apparently it isn't.

Now, it will take SEVERAL sprints to get any idea of a rough average. 20, 25, 22, 28 could all be points for sprints. The AVERAGE 23.75 points per sprint so far. Unfortunately, management will see the LAST sprint at 28 points and shoot for that, not even the average, which we'd statistically miss 50% of the time anyways. Our standard deviation is 3.66. So we can say that 68% of the time the team can deliver between 20.09 and 27.41 points. That means if we assign 20 points for a sprint, we have an 84% chance of actually delivering, at least that many points of work.

You'll notice in my made-up sprints that there is an upward trend. This is normal as the first few sprints the estimation is more conservative and teams are starting to get into a good cadence.

Once point estimation is stable, the team is well acquainted AND the requirements are regularly well defined, then the standard deviation will likely be pretty small. Requirements are the largest factor or lack thereof.

I've been expected to finish 40 hours worth of work in 16 hours of development and 15 seconds of estimation.

Manager: "Here look at this user story live in the meeting and estimate it. You've never seen it before, don't understand all the dependencies, but TELL ME how long it'll take, NOW!"

This is completely unfair, especially for a new developer to a team. It takes TIME, 6-12 months to get well acquainted with a code-base and project to really understand the work.

So hate failing sprints? LEARN WHAT AVERAGE MEANS.

Most of the time, estimation is completely worthless anyways. There is already a hard deadline for the whole project, there isn't a way to speed up development if needed and there work needs to get done anyways.
