The problem I have with Dev.to is that too many on here start to teach before they know anything. Rude, cocky egotistical persons that take technology like it's a religion.

Not to mention that they're racist. I had someone use my race as a way to discredit my story about offshore developers lying about their qualification. I have MANY friends from India, Turkey, Philipine etc that would agree with me that it happens a lot.

You can see it on their [code of conduct](https://dev.to/code-of-conduct)

Medium.com is also Woke and racist against white people.

Case and point, Tailwind CSS. It's a tool. It has its issues. So far I like it. But damn I swear everyone on here are Google level engineers telling me I'm dumb and it doesn't work at all.

If anyone replies about Tailwind specifically, I'll block them. You're missing the point. Critical thinking skills are rare these days. Everyone just wants to be online famous and appear smart. In order to be smart, you first have to be dumb.

There isn't one best technology or approach. I learn by 100% embracing a new concepts completely and abusing it to find the limits. I'm currently there with Tailwind. I'm starting to see some flaws as I scale a project with several junior developers.
