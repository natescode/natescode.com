Theory killed the cat

programming
As a beginner, you'll learn about some cool revolutionary concept like MVC, agile or OOP then think that is exactly how real projects work.

Heck, even after a decade in software, I'm still learning that most software practices are more religion than science.

"Give a boy a hammer, everything becomes a nail"

Or

"In theory, practice and theory are the same. In practice, they're not."

So this is how theory killed the cat.

Often there are solutions to problems that can be eliminated.

Theory is dangerous because it is untested and too often overlooks numerous real-world variables.

"In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they're not."

That's why this BeyondCode series is about going deeper and really asking WHY?

Agile / Scrum
Agile / Scrum have ruined software. I've never seen a project run well with it. Stop listening to snake-like salesmen.

Scrum points are meant to give a rough idea of effort on a user story or sprint as a whole. Yes, management thinks if the team completed 30 points last sprint they can do 35 this sprint, apparently they don't understand averages.

Unit Tests aka executable comment
This will definitely be a separate post. Unit Tests are 99% worthless. Sure, go ahead and argue the THEORY with me of how they catch bugs and regressions and how they make the code well architected.

In practice, they're poorly written, don't catch bugs because if you thought of the edge case before hand, your code would have accounted for it, tests or not.

Tests make everything dependency injected and harder to debug and execute more slowly. Also, have you tried mocking complex objects? I've spent 2 hours mocking code that took me 30 minutes to write.

Ultimately tests are a way to make management feel a false sense of safety. I've seen this at fortune 100 and 500 companies.

NO, test are NEVER the source of truth. That is the requirements document and specifications which often change. This only cements bad code in place.

Comments
Tests are just executable so comments are just worthless text. I know, I know. Your professor or senior lead with 30 years experience says comments are valuable. Ask them to prove it. Seriously.

I'm more for comments than tests.

When to comment
Religion vs Science
