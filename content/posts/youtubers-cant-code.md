## Those you cannot do, teach on YouTube

I recently offened a small YouTuber with my opinion that most YouTubers cannot code. This is true. MANY can learn the basics and make a 3 minute video about Javascript.

YouTubers get paid for views, NOT their coding skills. This does NOT mean all YouTubers are bad, including the one I offended. I'm a YouTuber after all.

Kevin Powell, SimonDev, Clement, Theo, ThePrimagen etc. Are all amazing Tech YouTubers that have significant real world exprience.

Mark Tellez, thinks C# and Java are "old" languages. Well, when I stop making $200k / year with C#, I'll agree with him. MOST jobs are in Java. Google prefers C++, Java, JavaScript and Python. He factually makes no sense! BUT SHHH that just pushes all the bad devs to Javascript only and keep my pay hirer because I'm a polyglot dev. I've coded in BASIC, Java, Groovy, Ruby, Powershell, bash, Javascript, Typescript, Purescript, Go and Rust.

People that care about programming languages don't know how to code in anything but JavaScript. C# is Microsoft's Java++. Language-wise it is objectively better than Java (NOT Kotlin, Groovy etc). BUT that doesn't matter because I choose languages based on their ecosystem. Java significantly beats C# in MANY use cases: docs, devs, tools, enterprise grade packages etc. I'm saying this as a C# dev. I do C# simply because that is what enterprise CMS's, financial and medical institutions use. That's it. At Stratasys, they use all C++ for the 3D printers, Java for the backend services for the printers BUT C# for the website because that is what Sitecore uses. That's it. I wrote Groovy at Best Buy, I wrote Ruby and Javascript at other places. Engineers care about solutions, NOT languages.

NatesCode is about teaching what I know. I will NEVER monetize NatesCode LLC outside of consulting and live education. I don't need the money nor the temptation to teach sofware solely for money; ads suck anyways.

## Learning is hard, views are easy

The reason tech has exploded is that it has been romanticized on social media. NO 70% of the population will never code at a professional level, no matter who teaches them.

Learning is hard. Students are lazy and entitled. They don't want to struggle. Thoy want to drop $20 for a course, or watch ads or spend $10k for a boot camp then magically know how to code at a level that make them $100k from their couch. SORRY that isn't how it works.

## Docs + Dev Env = Classroom

I learned to code with TWO resources and NO internet. I had the manual to my TI-84 graphing calcultor and the Calculator itself. I learned by trial and error. I use my imagination which no one seems to have anymore. I made programs for math class. Silly programs for myself and later a full text-based RPG game with some graphics. I didn't need anything but time.

### Python

Python REPL + Offical Python docs

### Go

Go playground and docs

### C++, C#, Java

Online REPL or LOCAL env + docs

### Web: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

Codepen.io + MDN

It really is that simple, NOT easy.

I'll admit, math and software are MUCH easier for me than probably 80% of the population. That isn't a brag, just truth. I don't do sports because I'm short, and uncoordinated.
