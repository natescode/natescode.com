Beyond Code: Beyond Ego

I've had my share of rude, mean and straight up assholes in my career. I have plenty of an ego, don't get me wrong but I never try to make anyone feel bad. That'd make me a bad Bootcamp instructor and senior developer.

I've been sworn at, called names, been told to work overtime only to have the team lead lie to management that he never told me to do so. I was even let go during COVID, working from home as a single father of twins, because I couldn't do 40 hours of work in 2 days, thanks "agile".

Anyways, it can't matter. That's the past. I never argue, I silently not and leave. I always prefer to make my actions speak louder than my words.

So how do we get beyond ego? Well, why are you so scared to be wrong? Are you threatened by a younger, more talented person? Are you jealous?

I always laugh when others think I'm talented at something, I have very few true talents. They don't know that I suck at almost everything I try but I am extremely obsessive. I'm an introvert that'll spend hundreds of hours teaching myself foreign languages because I can. If I'm good at something, it is because I've spent a TON of time being bad at it.

I have a friend who was a previous student of mine, Mark. Young, smart and driven. Much like myself. I know way more than he does when it comes to software. Does that mean he's always wrong? NO! I always intentionally listen carefully in case he discovers something that I hadn't, like a stupid Jotai / React bug today.

Plus, even if he's wrong. I can explain way which helps me learn how to teach. It also REALLY tests my knowledge. Knowing enough to survive is one thing but knowing something so deeply that you can teach someone else, that's a whole other level.

I love being challenged and learning. That's my passion. Teaching is how I continue to learn. Teaching is by far one of the most difficult endeavor I've yet undertaken.

"All can watch it. Many can do it, Some can do well it. Almost no one can teach someone to do it well." -- Nate Hedglin

I spent thousands of hours becoming a professional gambler. I was damn good at it too (ask any casino in the upper Midwest).

So let's spread positivity. I know I'm all too guilty of arguing with random people on the internet.
