Why I Dislike Managers
More of a rant posted about why management is terrible.

If everything is important, nothing is
Estimation is harmful
Don't be a slave
I had my manager tell me to live in Georgia (I was living in MN with my now ex-wife) and fly home on the weekends. I'd get $30 per diem but no promotion. I had nearly 3 years experience and was getting paid virtually the same as a bootcamp graduate.

I went to the big boss who was really nice, Andy. I quit when Michael was gone. Andy said I was close to my second promotion but not quite there and be patient. I told him I had NEVER been promoted. He was shocked. So I left for a $25k raise and no demand for me to live in a Red Roof hotel halfway across the country

Commuting to work with no one
I was driving 2 1/2 hours per day to sit next to other tech people I didn't work with. I'd meet in person with marketing once or twice per week but that was a different building.

Agile got me fired
Requirements are lies
Clients and management are like kids, they don't know what they want and are not happy when they don't get it.

Agile is a false Religion, Scrum Master a false god. (Separate post)
