I am a lead software engineer by day and a coding bootcamp instructor by night. Here are some prerequisites skills to know 
before attending a coding bootcamp.


## Basic Computer Skills

I see many students that don't know what a ZIP file is or how to unzip it. 

Basic computer shortcuts like copy (CTRL + C) and paste (CTRL + V).

Understanding how you files are structured i.e. you user folder aka home is `C:/users/your_name` on Windows.


## VS Code doesn't import files

Many students ask how to get file INTO VS Code. VS Code just views the files already there, no different than file explorer. This is also the same as the terminal which just uses text instead of pretty graphics.


## Touch Typing

You don't need to type 100 wpm but you should be able to touch type, type with all 10 fingers using the homerow keys without looking. You should be able to type at least 30 WPM with 98% accuracy as a bare minimum but 60 WPM is a good goal. Being a really slow and inaccurate typist will greatly slow you down. Software Engineers write code but we mostly write slack messages, Google queries, notes, documentation and of course code as well. Going from 30 WPM to 60 WPM could easily save an hour of work per day.
