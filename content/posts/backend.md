Again, even though we'll talk mostly about _nodejs_, I want to make sure I'm teaching you to be a _backend_ developer, not just a _node developer_. In fact,
I want you all to be great _software engineers_ not just _REACT developer_ or _JAVA developer_.

I've used C#, Javascript, Groovy, Bootstrap, Vue, React, AWS, Azure, Sitecore, Kentico, Optimizely etc in my career. I have done my best to not
be defined by a specific technology (I was by CMS dev for awhile. Hence the Sitecore, Kentico and Optimizely).

## Backend is its own Stack

Front-end is essentially HTML, CSS and Javascript. There is UX, A11y, i18n, performance etc of course to but essentially that is all front-end is. Some basic understanding of
the browser and HTTP is all that is needed.

Back-End is NOT just another front-end. There are numerous languages used on the backend: C#, Java, Groovy, PHP, Javascript, Go, Rust, C++, Ruby, Python etc.
