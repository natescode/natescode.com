Leetcode is overrated
Don't get me wrong. I like a good puzzle as much as the next dev. But I think too many YouTube course creators have sold Leetcode or l337c0d3 as some magic way to get a $300k Google job which isn't true at all.

I'm don't work for FANG or MAAAM or whatever but I am a senior developer with some good experience.

Software is about solving problems then translating vague human requirements into thousands of specific computer instructions. This can never be automated until we computers become sentient. Humans think, computers compute.

Data structures and algorithms ARE absolutely important. The basics I use regularly. I have NEVER written a novel algorithm that would be a leetcode medium question though.

There is a balance between theory and practice. Too much theory and you can't do anything practical. Too much practice and you can't do anything else.
