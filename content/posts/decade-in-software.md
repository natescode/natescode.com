## Coding for 17 years, Paid for 10

I'm almost 32 year old. I start coding at the age of 15 in 2006. I didn't get paid until early 2013.

I've worked for rude managers. I've been sworn and yelled at on my birthday for following instructions.
I've been fired during COVID for BS reason, I've been laid off etc. I've worked with developers that literally couldn't code, especially common
with developers from India and other countries.
