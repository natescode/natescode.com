So you graduated a coding bootcamp, or freecodecamp.org, or degree of some sort like AAS in programming or BS in Computer Science,
now what?

Here are some tips for my new graduates.

## Skills

While you're looking you should be working on your skills. Work backwards by finding the type of jobs you want and working on the skills they mention.

For my bootcamp students, just build stuff with what you've already learned. Maybe try Typescript but just master MERN first.

## Resume

I'm NOT the one to ask about having a good resume. Here are my tips though.

1. Make a linkedIn.com profile with professional photo and your work, project and education history. LinkedIn.com/jobs is how I found most of my jobs. Easy Apply is great!

2. Make a resume that is easy to parse by application websites. A pretty simple version of your LinkedIn profile in Word doc will work just fine.

3. Make a more professional version of your resume using Overleaf that can be exported as a PDF. I use this version for humans.

4. Ask for help with making your resume highlight your unique skills. Remember there are 10,000 other MERN bootcamp students who have the exact same projects and tech stack that you do. Learn Typescript, Vue, Angular, Go, Postgres etc will set you apart.
