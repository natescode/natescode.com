Pseudo-Random Post

At some point, ever new developer wants to create a random number. For me, it was making an RPG game in high school.

Computers are deterministic. So how do we get randomness ?

There are a few methods to generate Pseudo-Random numbers.

First, let's discuss what we mean by 'random' as there are several types of random.

True random - background noise sampling

Crypto Random - using maths to generate random numbers that are cryptographically secure

Periodic random - like LFSR generators can go through all possible numbers in a range before repeating. Great for shuffling a music playlist.

Sometimes "random" just means changing. Even if it isn't statistically random or cryptographically secure.

## Work Backwards

I say this WAY too often but it is true. First we have to clearly define our goal or problem. Sometimes "problems" are really just symptoms. THEN we work backwards to how to achieve the our goal.

The same applies for random numbers. What is our goal?

We'll build something today.
