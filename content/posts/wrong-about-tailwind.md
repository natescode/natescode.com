# I was wrong about Tailwind

discuss
So my latest new tech has been Tailwind. I like Tailwind and thought I'd stress test it with a client. It worked well for my client project but a discussion which started ouf as more of a heated argument started to change my mind. I'm not proud of my response, has enlightened me.

The Dichotomy
Tailwind OR UI component library is a false dichotomy. I've heard the haters say "but practically Tailwind users don't use component libraries" well then they're bad developers, it isn't Tailwind's fault. Most garbage developer are JavaScript-Only developers but that doesn't make JavaScript inherently bad.

One could use Meantime.io components, MUI or headless UI with Tailwind but very, very few actually do.

I love the Headless UI project and plan to contribute but that isn't production ready for enterprise applications, at least in my opinion.

Accessibility and Hubris
I think in a SMALL minority of cases should a company develop their own component library from scratch. A mistake I made with a client. Granted maybe not that costly since we didn't need to worry about complex ADA compliance too much for this client tool.

Tailwind stays; Approach Changes
Overall, I'm sticking with Tailwind for now. RB had a great point and reminded me who my enterprise work projects use components libraries. So I'll be using Mantine.io for NatesCode.com and NatesCodeCamp.org .

Utility Classes !== Inline Styles
Anyone who says utility classes aka Tailwind's approach is the same as inline styles don't understand the basics of CSS and should be fired.
