I'm Nathan, you can call me Nate. I write code. This is where I rant about code best practices and
show off my current projects. I pride myself on being unbias. I care about facts. I care about getting features shipped to clients. I care
about helping others learned to code. All the other stuff is just noise. I don't care to get 'likes', 'thumbs up', 'followers' or any money from
my NatesCode projects outside of my clients that pay me.
