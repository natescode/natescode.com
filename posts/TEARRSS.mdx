Computer science or Computer Fad. Fads vs Facts
I see a lot of strong opinions, fads and misunderstanding from the software industry. Especially from junior developers.

Recently, someone was arguing with me that C# was dumb because it had a feature, dynamic, that they never use and clearly didn't understand. I believe his emotions more likely caused more by some life trauma more than an obscure language feature.

Is software a science or art? There aren't always clear answers and there are numerous variables. Making the right choice is an NP complete problem. I'd call that an art.

I see a lot of hate or love for things based on fads not facts. Crypto is a good example.

Writing code is pretty easy but writing code tbat is scalable, secure, accessible, performant, extendible, testable, adaptable and resilient is extremely difficult and highly valuable. Anyone can write words, I'm doing it right now. But few can do it well enough to make a living from writing or get a Pulitzer prize.

My acronym for the qualities of good software is TEARRSS like years because without it you'll cry.

TEARRSS

Testable
Executable
A\*daptable
\*\*Responsive
Resilient
Scalable
Secure

Fads are a thing. JavaScript is a bit of a fad. MVC is not.
