Hello, World! I'm Nate.&#x20;

I'm a senior developer that has worked on mobile, and full-stack applications for the last 10 years.

I started by learning basic terminal commands as a kid to play video games on my old Dell. My dad put them in a 'Games' directory so I could just do 'dire Games' and see all of them.&#x20;

It wasn't until I was 15 that I learned to code on my TI-84 plus graphing calculator. At first, it was to just do my homework faster and to answer Mr. Smith's questions so my friends and I could get back to screwing around.&#x20;

It was my friend Adam that started to program and I followed after. He showed me some basics but nothing else. So I read the manual and got better. I made programs for other students, even one to perform synthetic division; I didn't even know how to do it.&#x20;

Later, I made games. TI-84's aren't very powerful. Crit chance, dodge, and basic health bar graphics were far too much for that poor hardware designed in the 1970's. I switched to C++ and OGRE (Object-oriented Graphcis Rendering Engine).

I'm extremely, SQUIRREL!, ADHD so I learned C++ decently well, and pursued other interests, namely linguistics and interpretation.&#x20;

After wasting $12k and a year of my life at a private religious university, I went to work in the oil fields. Tons of hours but I made enough to pay off my debt. I might have stayed but an older truck driver died in his truck on my shift, RIP Ray. That was a scary wakeup call. I didn't want to end up 70 years old and dying in my truck a thousand miles from my wife because I needed the money. So I went back to my home state to go back to college.&#x20;

I walked into the local community college to read their programs, I had nothing planned. I saw programming, something I had done before, and signed up. The rest is history as they say.&#x20;
