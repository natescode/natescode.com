Beyond Code: CRUD

Isn't backend just CRUD?
This is a naïve but really interesting question. Frontend development is far more popular with junior developers than backend.

Obviously the answer is 'no' but that just leaves the questioner with more questions. So let's go beyond CRUD.

One could argue backend really is JUST CRUD but that's kinda like saying frontend is just DOM manipulation or coding is just typing.

I'm currently building an eMAR or electronic medical record system. You might imagine the backend is really simple. Read patient info, write patient info, delete (technically archive) and update. BUT this system tracks their medications, when they were taken, who administered them, etc.

Databases
Data isn't just a bunch of flat files, even in NoSQL.

Types
Relationships
Constraints
Backup
History table

Encryption
Data Access Layer
ORMs
Security
DTOs
Business Logic Layer
Model Validate
Business Logic
Tests
Presentation Layer
View Models
Server Side rendering
Authentication
Caching
Queues
Scaling
Testing
Routing
API versioning
DNS
Proxies
CDNs
Conclusion
So yeah it's just CRUD. . .with a LOT of steps in between.

Backend: Beyond CRUD

There aren’t many backend posts on here. So many front-end, JavaScript-Only developers.

I want to dispell a few misconceptions about backend that I've read or been told by my bootcamp students.

Backend is just CRUD
Backend is ONE job
Backend developer is like saying Doctor. It is a pretty vague term. Are you an oncologist, OBGYM, ENT specialist, foot doctor, neurologist, anesthesiologist etc?

Backend fields

Presentation Layer
Internal API later
Business Logic Layer You develop the business logic of the application. You don't touch the REST API OR data access.
Process Layer Messages go through a queue system to be processed.

I figured I’d give backend some love. Without backend we just have pretty sites but no data, no communication and no logic. Backend is where all the data, communication and business logic happens.

I figured I’d share my experience as a backend developer. I write code for enterprise CMSs based on .NET. I wrote C#, HTML, CSS and JS.

Backend is a lot wider and deeper than front end. Networking, Cloud, DevOps, Security, Business logic, Databases etc. Each one can be a whole specialty and job title.

Front end on the other hand is deeper. The trifecta: HTML, CSS and JS.

I don't think backend is inherently better than frontend. Arguably, the tooling and paradigms are FAR more stable, better developed and backend developers tend to be better developers (because it is more difficult).
