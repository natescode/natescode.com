At some point, ever new developer wants to create a random number. For me, it was making an RPG game in high school.

Computers are deterministic. So how do we get randomness ?

There are a few methods to generate Pseudo-Random numbers.

First, let's discuss what we mean by 'random' as there are several types of random.

True random - background noise sampling

Crypto Random - using maths to generate random numbers that are cryptographically secure

Periodic random - like LFSR generators can go through all possible numbers in a range before repeating. Great for shuffling a music playlist.
