Complexity and Snake Oil

I was having another discussion on one of Thomas Hansen's great posts.

I mentioned how everywhere, including software, arbitrarily created complexity is a way to sell snake oil.

Fake Complexity" "SQL is difficult "
Snake oil: "NoSQL" (No SQL of course has its place)

I'm sure Thomas agrees that there ARE complexities to software but they're few and far between. Everyone wants to be the cool kid like Google but they're not.

Writing code is easy. Getting good requirements, realistic deadlines etc. is what is difficult. I'm on day 113 of doing nothing because a company can't even get my local environment workout. The laptop overheats constantly and I have no permissions to do my work.

Code is easy, people are difficult
I've never seen a project fail because of code issues. I've seen projects fail because incompetent non-developers were because they were cheap. Who hires those developers? Management. They were never vetted.

Snake Oil
Most Tech is like crypto, overly hyped and often more of a scam than actual useful.

While I enjoy reading on the latest JavaScript runtime or framework, that just highlights how terrible the JavaScript ecosystem and skillset of those developers are. While they're making Oogabooga.js, I'm actually getting work done and making money from clients. I would have loved to use Node, Typescript and TypeORM on the backend but it lacks security, stable packages and TypeORM had a bug that would cause data loss, that's a no go.

Complexity is HOW you sell snake oil. You make SQL sound difficult, maybe it is for low skill and lazy new developers, so they invented NoSQL! Yet, I've never seen NoSQL used by enterprises. It is a very narrow use case.

I've I convince you that losing weirdos complicated, them I can sell you meals, shakes, pills and special exercise devices.

Losing weight is simple, not easy, but simple. There isn't a person that can't lose weight, that's the law of thermodynamics. Some gain weight, a lot, more easily.
