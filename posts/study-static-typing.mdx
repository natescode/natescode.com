A study of Static Typing
Many developers fall into one of two camps: dynamic or static languages.

Which is better? No, really, show me the proof?

No one as far as I know has tried to do a scientific study to show the differences between static and dynamic typing. I'm not here to prove which is better but to gain information via the scientific method.

I did a small study to see IF static typing provides any benefits over dynamic typing.

Controlling Factors
First, we need to do our best to control for some factors.

Programming Languages
If we compare say C++ and Python, I'm afraid those languages are far too different to compare. C++ requires memory management and OOP style, while Python doesn't not.

Ideally, we'd have the same exact language but with optional static typing. Thankfully we do, JavaScript / Typescript.

Skill, Experience
I'll be there as much data as I can to account for the affect of skill and experience difference between developers.

Metrics
What are we measuring?

Speed of development, per unit test
number of runtime errors, per unit test
number of compilation errors
speed of understanding codebase
speed of refactoring large codebase
