I've noticed that front-end developers have now become "full-stack" developers thanks to Node. Yet, code quality and average developer skill continues to decrease annually. I think because now the newb JODS, JavaScript-Only Developers, don't want to learn any new languages; a new framework every fortnight is fine though.

I've seen all the buzz about the new Node runtime, Bun. Which is really the same thing that Deno was supposed to be. It seems the JS community cares more about reinventing the wheel, syntax and marketing new frameworks than actually getting anything done. If I want speed on the backend then I'd use Go for many use cases. Java/Groovy and C# would do as well. Yet those aren't options for these JODS because they do not know and are unwilling to learn new languages.
