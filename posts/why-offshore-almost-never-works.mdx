Why Offshore is more expensive, slower, and worse than onshore
Periodically, someone will ask, once again, the age-old question “Offshore developers work for so much cheaper than onshore developers. Are you afraid of losing your job to Offshore?”. After I stop laughing uncontrollably, I reply "No, because they're not developers".

\*Disclaimer
Before I get into it, I want to make it explicitly clear that even though I’m mostly talking about Indian developers, I am NOT talking poorly about the country or its wonderful people. Racism or prejudice of any kind is not tolerated. I hope this actually clears up the “bad Indian developer” stereotype.

I’ve worked with many talented developers from around the world. Furthermore, a developer’s value as a human is NOT their value as a developer. There are millions of developers better than me but make far less simply due to being born in a different country; unfair but that's life. So let’s leave the “I make six figures and I’ve worked at X company” ego at the door.

Back to the question. Not only have offshore developers NOT affected my career opportunities but they have CREATED MOST of them. 90% of my career has been in consulting. Inevitably, my employer (or my own company, NatesCode LLC) would be hired AFTER the client had hired a bunch of offshore developers to work for $30/hour for 30,000 hours (I’m exaggerating a bit).

Inevitablely, the code stop working, the code is hacked, the company gets sued, etc.

Here are several reasons why offshore doesn't work. First let's define why company are so obsessed with hiring non-developers to write code.

Why offshore?
Cost of living and the foreign exchange rate are big factors. A good Indian developer might make $2,000 USD per month, less than entry-level US jobs. The primary reason is to save money.

Profit Over People
You see, the one stereotype that is 100% true is that managers are stupid. They only care about cost-per-hour, and “speed”. I always tell them “fast, cheap, or good; pick two”. They laugh but never learn. Management sees two developers, one is onshore at $150 per hour, and the other is offshore at $40 per hour. They’ll choose the cheaper one every. single. time.

They don’t care if a team of cheap low-skill developers, that are just trying to earn their next meal, that have poor technical leadership will leave them open to a lawsuit, being hacked and leaking plaintext passwords, or deadly plane crashes; profit goes above all else.

This happens constantly, with offshore and onshore developers. The common denominator is poor management.

Would you hire an uneducated person off the street that doesn't understand your native language to perform a appendectomy (remove an appendix)? They only charge $9/hour. Why pay just thousands to multiple doctors ? Oh that's right because you actually value your life. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happens in software.

Eventually, after they’ve spent millions of dollars and buggy, broken software that still doesn’t work, they’ll realize that $9/hour isn’t a deal if they’re not getting anything for it and people die. Which is exactly what happens with Boeing planes.

I worked for an asset management company that wanted to rebuild its site. They hired me to maintain the site which would be finished in a few months. After 4 months with this highly recommended company, we’ll call them company H, there was absolutely ZERO usable code. I

I’ve literally seen my coding boot camp students write better CSS after 3 months than what they provided. I spent the next 6 months doing other projects as we interviewed numerous other implementation partners.

Selection Bias: Why Offshore aren't coders
Now, these offshore developers were horrible. India has like 4X the population of the United States. Why are their developers so bad?

Because they aren’t developers.

They’re either random people off the street or those with fake degrees that only know how to tweak code. They’ve never written even a Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch before. I interviewed a dozen “senior” developers with 4.7+ (yes they’d put fractional years of experience on their resume) and all but one could actually write basic code. By basic, I mean selecting a div by id in JavaScript. Most didn’t know the difference between ‘==’ and ‘===’ in JavaScript and call themselves experts.

Their ‘education’ is just memorization. They don’t have basic critical thinking skills either. They never ask clarifying questions. They often ramble on and on trying to sound smart. Which is pretty cocky thinking they can trick me since I know the answer to my own interview questions. Let’s talk about selection bias.

If I walked down the street, just maybe not in Silicon Valley, and picked a random person. How well do you think they’d write CSS? Horribly right? About the same as if I picked a random person to sing or play the piano. Those random people do NOT represent the best of the best, in fact, they may represent the worst. We have a bias to select the worst, not the best.
My Indian manager explained to the team that these Indian IT companies are just as cheap as the American companies. So they don’t hire good developers, which are always relatively expensive; Indian has plenty of them but again companies are too damn cheap. They literally hire people off the street. They can pay them a fraction of what they’d normally pay and pocket the difference. Sure, this isn’t a good long-term strategy but greedy people don’t think long-term.
This, of course, makes Indian developers look bad. Further pushing the stereotype of the bad Indian developer. Again, in most cases, they aren’t developers. They random people with poor education making minor code changes. They only care about the money to survive and the opportunity to move to management.

The vast majority of the top developers and IT managers in the US are Indian. why? Selection bias. Only the best of the best get visas and work their way up in the US.

Language and Culture Barrier
Indian languages, 22 official, are quite different than English. Learning a foreign language is difficult. Most Americans can’t remember how to order a chicken sandwich in Spanish after 2 years of Spanish classes, let alone actually get a job in a foreign language.

So if you combine the selection bias with the language barrier. Not only do you get the worse developers, but they struggle to understand. You also get the under-educated that don’t understand English very well. They have zero critical thinking skills and take everything literally. Their education prioritizes rote memorization over comprehension.
In my interviews, I found many developers that could answer my interview questions. This is because they had memorized the answers. The second I switched to open-ended critical-thinking questions such as “explain a few ways you’ve gotten data from the frontend to the backend”, their eyes glazed over. They don’t study. They haven’t written their own coding projects. They simply memorize and recite.

If I ask a “developer” to draw a picture of a horse-drawn carriage, they’d say “okay”. If they don’t understand what a horse-drawn carriage is, they don’t say anything. They don’t want to look dumb, saving face. If I ask if they understand they’ll say yes, which is lying by American cultural standards. Yet, after three days I’ll get back a picture of a horse and a cottage. They only heard one word, “HORSE” and ran with it.

Economics
Everyone has far fewer opportunities in India than in the US. IT is a good route to go. So many pursue that purely for economic reasons. The economics are different.

Again, all the GOOD Indian developers aren’t working for cheap IT consulting companies. They move to big companies within India or get H1B visas and move. I have good friends who are in the US on a work visa. They’re likely better developers than me.

As usual, the top always blames the bottom. Even if a team has bad developers, who hired those developers? Who keeps them employed? Who manages timelines? Management. Our India office was horrible at vetting candidates. Again, mostly because the candidates sounded great on paper but didn't actually have any skills. The thing is 5 years of experience is very different than experiencing the same year 5 times. Again, not completely the candidate's fault either. Most IT work in India isn't custom software but simple updates and fixes. You aren't going to learn to code by spending 5 years manually finding and replacing code or doing basic SQL updates.

My Experience

I’ve spent the better part of the last decade dealing with painfully manual and frankly child-like thinking to solve problems. I’m writing this at 7:00 am, as I’m watching one offshore developer spend the last 2 hours manually importing data into the production database. The software ‘solution’ if you can call it that, has cost my client well into the 7 figures and everything is manually done via SQL, in production, in plain text.

I’ve seen enough credit card numbers logged to know that offshore doesn’t work. A big reason is that management thinks ‘cheap’ somehow means they can take a nap, which is the exact opposite of what they should do. Bad managers hire bad developers. That’s the pattern. Doesn’t matter where they are from. That is ultimately my point here. There will always be bad developers. What makes or breaks a team and project is if management hires and keeps those bad developers.

"Bad managers hire bad developers. That’s the pattern. Doesn’t matter where they are from."

Culture, Language and Timezone barriers
Culture
Eventually, I've learned about panipuri and how to do the head bobble. I love Indian food. Indian culture is pretty different from US culture. Many times "Yes" really just translates to "I hear you" not so much that they'll actually do something. The Asian culture of saving face takes a bit of getting used to. In many cultures, it would just be called lying.

Language
Americans, unfortunately, are often monolingual, I'm not but Indians often speak 3 languages if not more. Indian languages are pretty different than English. Understanding thick accents can be difficult. I often run into language barriers where someone may understand the individual words I'm saying but not the meaning as whole.

Time zone
This can be a positive as handing things overnight can be useful. Other times it can be a huge barriers as I had to wake up at 5am to do an interview with an Indian candidate, only to find out that at 12am my time the interview was cancelled.

When offshore works; the “ALMOST”.
I don’t believe in clickbait or absolute titles. Most will ignore the “almost” in my title. For those that haven’t, congratulations!

WHEN DOES OFFSHORE WORK?
Offshore works when you clearly define the tasks, leaving no ambiguity. You treat offshore developers like really junior developers or interns. We hire offshore software developers, not software engineers. The companies that implement this approach find success with offshore developers. If you need a bunch of data entry done, or very simple code tweaked, then offshore is the way to go. If you need someone to think, then you need to VET your candidates well, onshore or offshore; I'd lean towards onshore.

I’m currently watching an offshore developer find and replace data in a spreadsheet because they don’t know about formatting columns in excel (yes, I’ve mentioned it to them and they finally did it).
Offshore is valuable in a VERY, VERY narrow use case. Usually, management is too damn lazy to define the work and requirements clearly enough to make offshore work.

As for my client, I’ll be spending the next year rebuilding their buggy, manual software from scratch. No more manual SQL in production or remoting into production servers. Spending $105,000 on a partial solution to make a form builder in JQuery, that already exists as an open-source project. . .oofda.

Here is a gem from a 'dev' company in Chetu. Besides plain text passwords, rolling their own authentication and numerous other issues. They didn't know that SQL has an ALTER TABLE command. So here is version two of the new table

Again, that is a prime example of poor management not asking the right questions or paying attention to what they are actually getting. Software isn’t like a valet. You can’t just leave the keys to your car and expect to get your car bad in one piece; or at all.

Conclusion
The vast majority of the time offshore doesn’t work because the price is prioritized over skill. Management gets lazy and doesn’t understand how software development actually works. They hire low-skill and cheap developers, from any country, which become a liability without a good management structure.
