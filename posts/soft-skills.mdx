Programmers write code, right? But that’s far from all they do. 10% - 60% of q developers day goes to non-coding tasks.

Let’s talk about some essential soft an peripheral skills that developers need.

I’m a full-stack JavaScript bootcamp instructor. I see a wide range of students and skill sets.

Break big, complex things into smaller, simpler things.
Students often get stuck. Often they see an error then frantically and seemingly randomly change code hoping it’ll work. There is no method to their madness.

I encourage them to slow down and think! That’s what programming is about. I’ve seen so many devs, especially junior and outsource devs, only memorize programming concepts but not actually know how to think about simple problems.

The code is throwing an error because something is null. Okay let’s work backward. Where does that line of code get the value? From an API? From the database via an ORM? Is the value Null in the database? If the value is Null in the database then where / when is it getting set?

These are mental skills not just coding skills. I’ve unfortunately worked with devs and managers that truly thought if they couldn’t access the server that the server was down.

I stress think think think and _psuedo code _ constantly to my students. I tell the my favorite quote

weeks of coding can save hours of planning.

someone wiser than me

Knowing how to deal with BS. I’ve had managers lie, throw me under the bus, scream at me on my birthday and much more.

Standing up to managers and co-workers is sometimes necessary. I flat out say “no”. I don’t aim to be rude but sometimes I give back the shit I get.

Too often I’ve been told to do 7 days of work in 2. That’s when I have to say “nope. Not gonna happen”. If Senior devs are disliked by companies, I think this is the biggest reason. Desperate, naïve, and broke junior devs can’t give management the middle finger, walk out and take a 6 month hiatus from work at a drop of a hat. Senior devs often can. I’ve always been able to thanks to side businesses and saving as much money as possible.
