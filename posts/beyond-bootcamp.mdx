You've spent the last 3-6 months busting your butt learning dozens of new concepts. You've built the projects that thousands had before you. You're a little baby developer, now what?

This is my list of skills to focus on after boot camp. You'll notice they're not technology-specific suggestions because boot campers tend to lack both soft and hard skills.

Review the Basics
I've hired some of my previous students as interns. I've noticed they often struggle with syntax. Understanding the basics of what is an identifier and what a keyword are really important.

You've learned a TON really quickly. Most of that knowledge is just floating and hasn't solidified yet in your brain.

Knowing 100+ NPM packages by heart won't get you a job, but being able to actually build a line of business applications will.

Think twice, code once
My students often get anxious and want to start coding immediately. They're impatient. Maybe they've seen too many movies where 'hackers' share a keyboard to quickly write code. Writing code is like painting a skyscraper with a tiny brush, tedious.

Understand the problem
Think of the solution
Break the solution down into steps
Pseudo-code + comments
Real code
Go deep, not wide
I can quickly identify junior developers by how they describe themselves. They'll say something like, "I know jQuery, JavaScript, Typescript, GraphQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, React, Vue, ember...". Then I'll ask the tough question: "yes, but what have you built?"

If you're hiring a carpenter to build you a house, do you care about the 300 tools he knows how to use? No, you'd look at his portfolio. I'm not saying specific languages or framework knowledge isn't valuable but I'm saying it isn't everything.

Concepts > Rote Memorization
I took a job doing Groovy + Spring Boot. I had never touched either of those technologies in my career. I was productive from day one, how? Because I understand the concepts, not just memorized the syntax. I quickly picked up the Groovy syntax and HOW it worked and Spring Boot well that was just MVC which I was already used to.

I once had a developer tell me that my HTML wouldn't work because I HAD TO use the C# Helper function, which generates HTML. He literally didn't understand that browsers don't understand C#. Code was rote memorization for him. You write this code to get this result, the why was a mystery. This will extremely limit your career and skill potential.

Beyond functions
There is too much push to focus on data structures and algorithms because of FAANG dream jobs. The problem with algorithms is that they're just functions. Real software is made up of more than just one function. How do you architect your solution? Get different parts of your application to communicate?

Software is 99% NOT about writing novel algorithms, I've never written one in a decade of software.

I encourage junior developers to build something out of their skill-set. Build a game, build your own compiler or emulator. Build your own version of React to understand how it works.

New Concepts
Static Typing
I highly recommend learning Typescript. Not because of Typescript but because of static typing. Most JavaScript only developers have a very poor understanding of types and type systems. I think picking up a statically typed language like Typescript, C#, Java (or any JVM language), OCaml etc are a good idea.

Functional Programming
Haskell, Purescript, ELM. Definitely makes you think.

Interviews
Just interviewing as much as you can will help you learn what employers are looking for. Don't underestimate soft skills.

When I interview developers I always ask one question they won't know the answer to, This shows me how they handle pressure and if they can't admit they don't know something.

One sentence. One Paragraph Rule.
The ability to explain concepts simply is important. I suggest using my one-sentence-one-paragraph rule. Answer first with a short sentence, pause to let the interviewer acknowledge then a short paragraph of more important. Here is an example:

Interview: "What is an interface?"
Developer: "An interface is a contract", pause.
Interview: "Contract? Explain"
Developer: "An interface is a contract that a class or object implements a specific structure: properties or methods with specific signatures. "

Build stuff !
No, I don't mean just code silly things. No, don't follow along the 30 courses you've bookmarked or purchased. I mean build something, anything completely on your own. Get stuck. Look up answers to. Learn. Progress.

Start simple and work your way up. Add tests, refactor to be more OOP or functional. Implement a few design patterns to see their use. Try a few different approaches. This is how I learned before there were 3 million courses out there. You can't download coding skills like how Neo learned Kung Fu. You have to do the work.
