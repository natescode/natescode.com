Welcome to my new fundamentals series.

What is a Type?
I like asking the most basic questions. Those are the hardest after all. Everything else is built off of those definitions.

You might think you know what a Bicycle is and how to recognize one, until you have to teach a computer to do the same.

If you can't explain something in a single sentence, at least at a high level, you probably don't know it very well.

What is a Type?
"A type is a set of valid values" - NatesCode

That's it. Sure there is A LOT more to it like operations are restricted to certain types but ultimately that is what types are.

Let's try to relate this to code.
const isAlive = true
Now, JavaScript has types. They're dynamic, meaning the type associated to a variable may change. At runtime, isAlive will be a boolean type.

Boolean only has two valid values: true and false.

We could define our own type with our desired valid values. This is clearer in Typescript.
type greeting = 'Hello' | 'Hi' | 'Howdy' | 'Sup'
The pipe | means OR. So a greeting is type with only those four strings as valid values.
