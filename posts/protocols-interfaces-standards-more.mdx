Protocols, Interfaces, Standards and more.

I'm excited to release this post. This is an absolutely critical post full of fundamental concepts.

Interfaces
"What is an interface?"

This is one of my favorite interview questions. The answer changes depending on the developer's experience.

"An interface is a point where two or more systems or components interact or communicate" - NatesCode

That isn't limited to software! Doorknob is an interface, wheel is an interface, touchscreen is an interface, Even Dev is an interface between me and my readers.

Interface = is an implicit or explicit contract for the interaction with or structure of something.

I.E. we can define a vehicle as anything with two pedals, a wheel and a shifter.

Now any implementation of vehicle can be driven. I am drive a truck, bus, car or go kart.

This is why Google's case with Oracle was critical. Google copied oracle's interface (the code that defined the interfaces in Java). Of Oracle had own, that would be a precedent that someone could own THE wheel, not a wheel but the whole idea of a circular object that turns to control something.

Protocol
A Protocol is a set of rules for interaction. Protocols apply to interfaces.

I said Dev.to is an interface, connection point between me and my readers. Dev.to has community guidelines and rules. We may agree to communicate I'm English and Spanish (languages I speak). Which is our protocol.

Interface - Where we interact
Protocol - How we interact

Specification
JavaScript is based on the ECMAscript specification.

A specification is a blueprint for how something should be made. It defined the interfaces and protocols but NOT the implementation.

I could make a JavaScript engine in Rust or C++ or Python. In fact, browsers all implement that specification differently, and sometimes don't adhere to it.
