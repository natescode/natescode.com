GIT merges are pretty dumb. Git only looks and lines of text, not code.

["John","Sarah"]

["John,"Sarah", "Jos√©"]
["John", "Sarah", "Omar"]
These aren't actually conflicts. Both developers simply added items to the array. According to GIT which literally means "dumb", they're conflicts.

There is only one tool that does semantic merging but they don't support JavaScript, C# or other major languages.

Since, this is a parsing problem and I love parsing, I made LexGit! LexGit will automatically resolve these conflicts for you.
