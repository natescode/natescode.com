Day 111: Enterprise Incompetence

I've worked most of my 10 year career building enterprise software for medical and financial institutions. One thing I can say about them is the bigger they are, the less efficient they run.

Economies of scale might apply to production but definitely not human collaboration.

You might wonder what day 111 is. Today is the 111th that I, as a contractor for **\*\***, STILL DON'T HAVE A WORKING LAPTOP. Yes, the client sent me a laptop months ago but I couldn't get it setup. I followed their documentation and had over a dozen people help.

111 days or 634 "working" hours. I can't imagine what rate my company is billing the client for my "work\*.

I'm writing this at the breakfast table as my girlfriend makes breakfast, something I usually do. The twins are playing while I'm on the call with IT to change my VPN password because their VPN reset screen doesn't work, no surprise.

I'll be waiting for some underpaid Indian to not understand what I need and hangup on me.

Conclusion
Well, hopefully this adventure will end soon. I took on a NatesCode LLC client full-time for awhile to give myself something to do. Eventually the client went crazy, and I quit. That's a whole different story.
