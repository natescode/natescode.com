SAFE and sound code
I have my own website natescode. I have don't software consulting / contracting on the side and have my own NatesCode LLC even. I had a very basic, and ugly site that thankfully no one ever looked at. Mainly the site is mean for blogging but alas Dev.to is much easier.

I read a great article about using ReasonML and Rust for a project that was actually used by a client. He was happy to experiment with his tech stack for this little project. I found myself in the same position. Though I do have some serious projects in mind in the future.

So here's everything I wanted:

Functional, Type safe, ideally purely functional.
React compatibility
Full-Stack: client (targeting JS), Server
Great tooling: IDE, compiler, platforms
Great support: documentation, development
This is a LOT to ask. Great tooling and support already weeds out a lot of experimental techs like TinyGo, Purescript etc. Elm looked cool but I wanted React.

I knew Microsoft had Blazor with C# but I hated that once again they're trying abstract away too much (vendor lock-in) with their obsession with all forms of "forms" (pun intended).

Then I found the SAFE stack. It is a toolset built around F# on .Net Core that targets all platforms: web browsers, server, desktop and mobile. F# can leverage all of the .Net Core libraries which is amazing. F# is backed and developed by Microsoft. Everything I wanted from Reason and more. Plus awesome IDE support: Visual Studio or in my case Rider (Love you Jetbrains!)

F# with .net core can target mobile with Xamarin but since I'm using React (and I like the web UI), then I can target mobile with react-native if I want (I'll likely use Xamarin instead but thats an experiment for another day)
