Senior != Omniscient

I see to many posts all over the web, from clearly junior developers that are preaching their way as if they're experts. They even get offended and defensive when I ask simple questions.

What is worse, is when "senior" developers do it. I say senior in quotes because they're acting immaturely and seniors don't know everything. I've met plenty of senior developers that had no idea how Git works, how to do basic CSS layouts or write basic JavaScript. Senior is often defined by years of experience more than actual skill. Seniors don't know everything about everything. I see too much ego "I have X experience and I've worked at FAANG and I make 6 figures, I know everything" isn't helping anyone.

This is more about clout and "looking smart" instead of actually being smart.

This is a really bad attitude to have as a developer, no matter how smart and experienced you think you are. I've been shut down by dinosaur developers that hadn't learned anything new in 20 years and told me I was wrong, when later I was proven correct. I've also learned new things from developers many years my junior. I don't care if I'm "more experienced", I'm here to do my job the best I can and sometimes someone else just sees an answer I simply couldn't see myself.

If someone offers advice, kindly accept it. I wouldn't be here to help if I didn't care. I have nothing to promote or prove to anyone.

So let's leave our egos at the door shall we?
