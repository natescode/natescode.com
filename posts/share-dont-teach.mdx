I REALLY like Dev.to but like most of the web, there are far more beginner programmers than seasoned professionals. The Dunning-Kruger effect is quite apparent in numerous posts.

If you're a teenager with zero professional experience or junior developer then please share your journey, share your projects, ask for help etc. But DO NOT TEACH. Don't try to tell others what they should or shouldn't do. That technology X is bad when you've only ever played with it.

I see far too many strong opinions that aren't backed by experience or deep knowledge.

This is too prevalent, especially from developers that care more about looking smart than actually being smart.

I don't want to discourage anyone from blogging (blog is Biographical Log after all) but I don't want to see the web polluted with more low-quality JavaScript-only teaching blog posts. This doesn't help other new developers that may form the wrong opinions or ideas because they're learning from someone with hardly anymore experience than themselves; the blind leading the blind.

What are your thoughts?
