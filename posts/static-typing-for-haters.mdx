I see a lot of posts thinking static typing is dumb and has no value. Which of course couldn't be farther from the truth.

The thing is, we ALWAYS have to think about types but they're not always well defined.

More than Types
Dynamic typed developers don't understand types very well.

Rust is extremely popular because it turned a class of bugs INTO type errors.

I see my interns, junior developers and offshore developers (even with 5+ experience they're more ata junior developer level), run into type errors regularly.

I've seen a whole code base that didn't even compile.

Now, static typing isn't all rainbows ðŸŒˆ and unicorns ðŸ¦„. There is a cost.

History of Statically Typed language
Historically, static typing and manually memory management were married.
