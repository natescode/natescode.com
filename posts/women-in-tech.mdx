## A Lesson in Statistics

If you spend anytime in tech, you'll hear about the push to get more women into tech. While a noble effort, it is often backed by false conclusions.

> "women make 70 cents for ever 1 dollar a man makes", for the same job, hours etc... 100% only because of sexism. -- misinformed person

This is

1. completely false
2. harmful to women trying to make it in the tech world.

This is teaching women to fear working in male dominated fields. Which keeps out talented women from pursuing a STEM career in the first place. This also makes people look like they failed statistics.

## Income vs Pay Rate

If Luna and Max both make $20/hour, they have the same _pay rate_. If Max works 46 hours per week and Luna works 40 then Max will make $980 (1.5X for overtime in US) and Luna $800. Luna makes **81.6% ** of what Max does; an _income_ gap. Overtime and unpaid time off major factors in total _income_. The gap isn't inherently proof of sexism. Yet many feminists lie and say women are paid less than men for the same job and hours.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics does NOT give enough information to know _if_ women are paid differently than men when accounting for experience, career, specialty, skills, hours work, unpaid PTO etc. It merely gets the average income of all men and all women. Men and women tend to chose different careers. Comparing school teachers to engineers is an apples-to-oranges comparison.

Now, I want to be clear, I'm not stating there isn't a pay gap at all. I'm simply stating that a 30% gap is because of difference in specialty, hours worked etc.

Men dominate 9/10 of the highest paying college degrees.

The following quoted and linked paper showed that women made 82% (**INCOME GAP** of what men made as union workers where the ONLY factor for _pay rate_ is seniority (years of experience). The only two factors towards total compensations were hours worked (overtime) and unpaid time off via FMLA.

> "Mechanically, the earnings gap can be explained in our setting by the fact that men take
> 48% fewer unpaid hours off and work 83% more overtime hours per year than women"

Statistics are dangerous because humans jump to conclusions. The report shows TOTAL earnings of all men and women that work full-time. Full-time is defined as 35+ hours per week. Total hours worked, specialty and years of experience aren't taken into account. To try to use this date to prove there is sexism is incorrect. We simply cannot conclude either way from this data.
The

Yes, men make more but men also work more hours doing more dangerous jobs. Now if we adjust for these factors to specifically find the gap that is solely based on gender, then great! Then we'd have data to discuss and a possible gender pay gap to fix. The US Bureau of Labor statistics does NOT account for this and thusly is worthless in determining if women are paid less simply because they are women.

Again, Women do have their struggles. For example, even where studies appropriate compare _pay rate_ between men and women, that still won't show if there is discrimination in the hiring process. You can't compare if a woman doesn't get the job at all.
Mainly, they do most of the unpaid household labor, child rearing and in third world countries fetching water etc. This is why unpaid labor should be included in a nation's GDP. Phyllis Deane came up with this idea but she was shut down by men who didn't think unpaid female

To say that women are actually making 82% of what a man makes for working the SAME job and the SAME hours is a straight out lie and illegal; in the United States at least since the [1963 equal pay act](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/equal-pay-act-1963). There is ZERO evidence of such a large gap. I'm not saying laws completely prevent sexist employer practices, they sadly do not.

I want my daughters to pursue whatever career they desire. Hearing that they make less for the same job and hours as men doesn't help them, especially when it isn't true. These lies only keep women out of tech. We need people of all types in tech. I made far more than all my female class-mates in high school. Why? Because I did dirty, outside, laborious jobs. I was crawling under cabins to silver soldering burst pipes or bailing hay.

We need to keep everyone informed of facts and encourage everyone to pursue whatever they want, not just STEM. We push women into STEM yet not into blue collar jobs like trucking, machining, plumbing, construction, landscaping etc. . .we are 90%+ male dominated, why? Because feminists only want equality at the top aka a double standard, not true equality. I.E. Women in the US get to vote and get federal student loans without signing up for the selective service (draft) while men do. Equal rights, less responsibility.

Everyone should pursue STEM or science in general, requires logic the scientific method. If we abandon logic for emotions then can no longer help anyone.

STEM is about facts and following the scientific method. Not about feelings.

I hope this helps clear up some myths and encourages women that would otherwise avoid STEM. While sexism unfortunately exists in my other areas, no you won't get a 20% pay cut just because you lack a Y chromosome.
