      <description>I wanted a fancy title that wasn&amp;rsquo;t clickbaity. I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with a coding approach at work that I want to share. At work, like any good company we write tests for our code. Not always first, but at least we generally have quality tests. The IT Director has pushed hard for code coverage which I strongly disagree with. One engineer spend 2 full days writing tests in order to commit 17 lines of code because the code coverage percentage fell, oh no we ONLY had 95% code coverage.</description>
