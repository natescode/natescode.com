      <description>Pair Programming is a part of of XP programming which seemed to be pushed mostly in the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s. I have heard that it can work, of course it sounds like a huge waste of time most of the time.&#xA;Pair Programming Defined I think we need to define it. Some XP evangelists say that one person coding and another watching is NOT pair programming. Ok, then what it?&#xA;There are tools for IDEs / editors for developers to code on the same code at the same time.</description>

      <description>I am a lead software engineer by day and a coding bootcamp instructor by night. Here are some prerequisites skills to know before attending a coding bootcamp.&#xA;Basic Computer Skills I see many students that don&amp;rsquo;t know what a ZIP file is or how to unzip it.&#xA;Basic computer shortcuts like copy (CTRL + C) and paste (CTRL + V).&#xA;Understanding how you files are structured i.e. you user folder aka home is C:/users/your_name on Windows.</description>

      <description>Computer Science students, bootcampers etc. Often think a career in software is solely defined by their hard technical skills. In fact, they may think that in order to get promoted they have to demonstrate only technical skills.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover five soft-skill concepts developers need to understand.&#xA;Understanding Agile People Skills </description>

      <title>OOP vs FP</title>

      <description>There has been numerous reactions to the reactions to the reactions of a certain Tech Influencer, who works at Netflix BTW, reacting to a Continuous Deliver video about OOP vs FP.&#xA;FP Functions are the main abstraction Functions are pure a) referential transparency: same output for a given input b) no side-effects: no mutation, no outside state (no IO) First, let&amp;rsquo;s actually define OOP and FP. FP is the easiest to define because it is based on lambda calculus.</description>

      <description>Microservices is another hot buzzword in tech right now. I&amp;rsquo;m not hear to talk bad about microservices; I&amp;rsquo;m no expert. I have had some experience though.&#xA;Best Buy I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the payment information. Completely separate services and database. So I didn&amp;rsquo;t do the task. The fact my manager was mad says a lot. Did he NOT look at the user story? That is a really easy thing to catch. Backroom does not have any pricing information.</description>

      <description>Monad Definition:&#xA;Monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s it!&#xA;Just kidding.&#xA;Monad is a container type that has some associated methods&#xA;interface monad&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { wrap(T): Monad&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;; unwrap&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(): T; map(monad: monad&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;): monad&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;; flatmap(monad: monad&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, fn): monad&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;; } The simplist monad is an array.&#xA;[1]; We can unwrap the array and get the containing values.&#xA;function unwrap(array:[]any):any { return array[0] } we can wrap a value into an array</description>

      <title>Referential Transparency</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023/08/referential-transparency/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023/08/referential-transparency/</guid>
      <description>Referential Transparency is a confusing term. It is a really simple concept, I promise.&#xA;Referential Transparency is a fancy term for the substitution property of equality. Meaning = really means those two things are equal and interchangeable.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s see as simple example.&#xA;const a = 1; a + a === 1 + 1; // true If a = 1 then we can replace all instances of a with 1 and everything works the same.</description>
