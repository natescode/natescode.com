      <description>I notice that when I have discourse with other developers online that there is a disconnect. Most developers, about 58%, have less than 10 years of experience. This means that more often than not, I have more experience than the developer I am debating with. Experience doesn&amp;rsquo;t make me correct of course, I&amp;rsquo;m a mediocre developer at best. However, having more experience means that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen &amp;ldquo;TDD&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Agile&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ORMs&amp;rdquo; and many other technologies, methodogies both succeed and fail in real-world use.</description>

      <description>Typing efficiency and speed is an often underrated and underappreciated skill for new and novice developers. I teach a coding bootcamp. I see adults of all ages, talents, backgrounds and walks of life start their journey into software development.&#xA;One issue, of many, I have with coding bootcamps is that they say there are no prerequisits when there definitely are. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen students start bootcamp with a brand-new laptop, likely their first, log onto the Zoom class all bright eyed with ethusiam and wonder.</description>
