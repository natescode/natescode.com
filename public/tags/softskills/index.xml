I see adults of all ages, talents, backgrounds and walks of life start their journey into software development.&#xA;One issue, of many, I have with coding bootcamps is that they say there are no prerequisits when there definitely are. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen students start bootcamp with a brand-new laptop, likely their first, log onto the Zoom class all bright eyed with ethusiam and wonder.</description>
