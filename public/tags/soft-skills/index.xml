      <description>Productivity Life Hacks for Sofware Engineers.&#xA;My co-worker, Abdullahi, encouraged me to write this post. Since I&amp;rsquo;m on Thanskgiving vacation, I thought why not? Plus, writting this post proves him correct; I&amp;rsquo;m very productive.&#xA;I generally don&amp;rsquo;t think of myself as very productive. I was diagnosed with ADHD, like my father, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always tried to take on too many projects, jobs and challenges at once.&#xA;I work 2 jobs, sometimes 3, I am a father of twin girls that are in school plus I make time to work on NatesCode blog posts, videos, exercise and be a son, boyfriend and play DnD.</description>

      <title>Software Symptoms vs Problems</title>

      <description>Symptoms vs Problems is something I&amp;rsquo;ve run into a lot lately. For example, our production support team has received multiple tickets about a specific screen, let&amp;rsquo;s call it QuickEdit, that allows the users to quickly edit some data. On save, the request will often timeout.&#xA;According to the business, they ask if we can just quickly fix this page. Maybe not allow multi-editing. The issue isn&amp;rsquo;t on the UI, that&amp;rsquo;s just where we see the symptom.</description>
