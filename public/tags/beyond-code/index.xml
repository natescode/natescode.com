      <description>My co-worker, Abdullahi, encouraged me to write this post. Since I&amp;rsquo;m on Thanskgiving vacation, I thought why not? Plus, writting this post proves him correct; I&amp;rsquo;m very productive.&#xA;I generally don&amp;rsquo;t think of myself as very productive. I was diagnosed with ADHD. I&amp;rsquo;ve always tried to take on too many projects, jobs and challenges; failing multiple responsibilities simultaneously.&#xA;I work 2 jobs, sometimes 3, I am a father of twin girls that are in school plus I make time to work on NatesCode blog posts, videos, exercise and be a son, boyfriend and play DnD.</description>
